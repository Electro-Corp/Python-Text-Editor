# Python-Text-Editor
Python Text Editor<br>
Currently only one file, `main.py`(not for long as I add more things...)<br>
Should work on any system that supports python, as it only uses built in librarys<br>

# Built in File-Format, .tex
.tex is the file format that it uses, tho it can save and read other formats too.<br>
.tex format: <br>
```
FONT
(font data here)
TEXT
(text for file here)
```
Will increase in complexity as time goes on..
