# Python-Text-Editor
Python Text Editor<br>
Currently , `main.py`, for the tk window init, and `texteditor.py`, for the real app.<br>
Should work on any system that supports python, as it only uses built in librarys<br>

# Built in File-Format, .rbtf (really bad text format)
.rbtf is the file format that it uses, tho it can save and read other formats too.<br>
.rbtf format: <br>
```
FONT
(font data here)
TEXT
(text for file here)
```
Will increase in complexity as time goes on..

# Built in C++ and Python Compiling
As long as your computer has G++ and Python3
